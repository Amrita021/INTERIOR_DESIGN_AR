# INTERIOR_DESIGN_AR
Focuses on integrating augmented reality (AR) technology into interior design. The goal is to improve how interior spaces are visualized, experienced, and designed.Here AR is used to overlay digital elements like furniture and decor onto a real-world environment. This helps designers and clients visualize how different design elements will look and fit within an actual space.By using AR, clients can interact with and see potential design changes in their own homes. This enhances their involvement in the design process, leading to better-informed decisions and a stronger sense of ownership over the final design.This allows designers to quickly experiment with different design options without the need for physical samples. This speeds up the design process and reduces costs by allowing rapid adjustments based on client feedback.Provides a Interactive experience to the clients.This project involves scanning a room to create a 3D model. Users can then place virtual design elements within this model, add items to a virtual cart, and view the estimated cost. This interactive approach helps clients choose appropriate items and ensures that selected products are suitable for their space.The primary focus is on creating an interactive and user-friendly environment that enhances the design process, improves client engagement, and helps avoid mismatches between design elements and the actual space.
